## The Network API

The Network API is a lower-level API designed to allow users the power and flexibility to construct hierarchical structures of nodes. Watch this video for an overview:

The Network API interface is defined in C++, but also exported in a Python interface. So it can be used from either C++ or Python.

> An HTM Network is a collection of Regions that implement HTM algorithms and other algorithms. The Network Engine allows users to create and manipulate HTM Networks

See the [Network API](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Network-API) wiki page for a complete description. Examples of Network API usages can be found at [`examples/network`](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/tree/master/examples/network).
