# Simple Prediction Example

This is a very basic example of OPF usage given already-created [model parameters](model_params.py). A simple script called [hotgym.py](hotgym.py) creates a NuPIC Model and feeds lines of data from an input CSV file into the model. Also contains an example of how to use Metrics. Output data is managed with MetricsManager and dumped to stdout.
